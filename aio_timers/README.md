This directory contains a tweaked copy of Thierry Spetebroot's MIT-licensed
aio-timers library (https://pypi.org/project/aio-timers/#history), which is very
useful for this project.

The library has since fallen out of compatibility with the modern version of
pip used by Fly.IO, and the developer has since removed the original GitHub
repo. This copy of the package's contents ensures that it keeps working.

Since aio-timers was MIT licensed and this is certainly a substantial portion of
the software, I must include a copy of the MIT notice. I don't know the exact
year of production, but can verify that the most recent vesion of aio-timers is
dated 2018-06-24.
