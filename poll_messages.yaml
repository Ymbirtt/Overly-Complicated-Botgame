      message: "Hello friends! I have taken over from @ymbirtt so that he doesn't have to talk to you any more! Poll messages look like this now. This tool supports both scheduled messages and a set of random messages. If you want to add something dumb to the set of random messages, @ymbirtt can add it to the file. If you have a birthday coming up or a new game or something, let @ymbirtt know and he can add it to my schedule, and then the text will appear in the poll like magic. In fact, this entire poll message came out of that same scheduler! How clever! Anyway..."
